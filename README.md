# 4thSEM_Project
This project involves making a website using streamlit, where users have to give their address, well basically not the address but the longitude and latitude of the address.
Then it takes those as inputs and with the help of machine leraning model it will predict the taxi fare.
In this project, I have firstly analyzed the data, clean them, preprocess them using python library
pandas, numpy and visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn for better analysis.
Then with the help of scikit learn, the ML library, I have built and trained the model using the dataset, which will predict the future uber journey price.
